# Implementation notes and known deviations

This decoder is ported from [jxlatte](https://github.com/Traneptora/jxlatte)
(MIT) and inherits its behavior. Divergences from libjxl (`djxl`) observed
during gate testing:

## Lossless (modular)

Bit-exact against `djxl` on the entire local corpus and the modular
conformance testcases. No known deviations.

## Lossy (VarDCT)

- Output matches jxlatte to within **1 of 255** (differences from
  double-vs-float arithmetic in a few spots).
- jxlatte itself — and therefore this decoder — deviates from libjxl by up
  to ~26/255 on isolated **large-DCT varblocks** (DCT 16x32 and larger),
  concentrated in low-frequency LLF components. Overall RMSE stays below
  ~1.7/255 even on smooth gradients at d2; typical images are ~0.4–0.9
  RMSE. Verified by decoding the same files with jxlatte: its
  output-vs-djxl error is identical to ours (e.g. color_cover_d2.0_e1:
  rmse 1.679, max 23 for both).
- Suspected cause: float precision in the quant-weight interpolation
  (`getDCTQuantWeights`/`interpolate`) or the long-IDCT LUT accumulation
  order. Candidate for a post-1.0 precision pass against libjxl's
  `dec_xyb`/`quant_weights` computations.

## Default squeeze parameters with meta channels

jxlatte derives default squeeze parameters from `channels[0]`; libjxl uses
`channel[nb_meta_channels]`. This port follows **libjxl** (the spec-correct
choice). Only affects files combining palette + `--responsive=1`.

## Patch blend modes

jxlatte's patch-mode remapping mishandles patch modes 3 (mul) and 4 (blend
above); this port maps all eight patch modes per the spec table.

The `patches` conformance testcase (alpha-blended patches over a VarDCT
frame) deviates from djxl at rmse ~21.9 / max 77 — identically in jxlatte
(verified) and in this port. Root cause is somewhere in jxlatte's
alpha-weighted patch blending; tracked for a fix against libjxl's
dec_patch_dictionary. `patches_lossless` (additive patches) is bit-exact.

## Output color pipeline

XYB images are inverted to linear RGB with the image's primaries, then
encoded with the header's *enum* transfer function. Files whose color is
only described by an embedded ICC profile (`want_icc`) are decoded as if
tagged sRGB; a full ICC-driven output transform is out of scope for v1
(the raw ICC profile is exposed on `JxlImage.iccProfile`).

## Performance status

Lossless decoding runs at ~3.5x single-threaded djxl. Lossy decoding of a
3.4-megapixel page takes ~0.4-0.65 s single-threaded (djxl: ~0.1 s); a
real-world JPEG-transcoded manga page decodes in ~0.3 s. The float
pipeline uses dart:typed_data Float32x4 SIMD (native NEON/SSE under AOT):
the fused 8x8 inverse DCT (in-register transposes), coefficient
dequantization (float-arithmetic lane masks; Int32x4 select boxes in
AOT), the XYB opsin inverse, gaborish, and the EPF interior (8-pixel
groups so the per-block sigma and border-lane pattern are constant per
group; +-1 neighbors via shuffle + lane insert, +-2 via one shuffleMix).
Larger DCTs use Lee's O(N log N) recursion with unrolled 2/4/8-point
kernels. Weight matrices and coefficient orders are generated lazily per
transform type actually used. On a 3.4MP page the EPF pass runs in
~57 ms and gaborish in ~34 ms.

Note for Flutter Web: dart2js emulates Float32x4 in software, so lossy
decoding is substantially slower there; AOT targets (Android/iOS/desktop)
get native SIMD. Remaining gap vs libjxl is threading and deeper SIMD.

A hard-won Dart AOT lesson encoded in the hot paths: never derive a
`List<Float32List>` used in a hot loop from a nested
`List<List<Float32List>>` (or similar generic container) inside the hot
function - pass the per-channel row lists as direct parameters from a
call site where the concrete list class is statically known. Violating
this costs 5-20x in pixel loops.

## Real-world validation

Two commercially-distributed CBZ chapters containing JPEG-transcoded JXL
pages (VarDCT + JPEG reconstruction data, YCbCr 4:2:0; 1066x1600 B/W and
up to 1920x1508 full color) decode with zero failures: all 34 pages match
djxl within a max pixel difference of 1/255, ~0.3-0.4 s per page AOT
single-threaded. The `jbrd` JPEG reconstruction box is ignored; pixels
decode through the normal VarDCT path (byte-exact JPEG re-emission is out
of scope).

Deviation fixed relative to jxlatte: chroma upsampling (subsampling
inversion) mirrors its neighbor taps at the *visible* subsampled extent,
as libjxl's render pipeline does. jxlatte reads the padded DCT samples
beyond ceil(visible/2) instead, which shifts the final visible row of
4:2:0 images whose height is even but not a block multiple (verified:
jxlatte deviates from djxl by up to 10/255 on such a row; we match djxl
to 1/255 after the fix).
